# Real Estate Market Analysis

## Introduction

This project presents a preliminary analysis of housing market trends based on data from the `house_prices.csv` dataset. As a **Data Analyst** at a real estate company, I was tasked with exploring this dataset to uncover meaningful insights that can inform business decisions and identify potential growth opportunities in the housing market.

The company aims to understand the **key factors that influence house prices**, including structural features and location-based variables. Through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using **Pandas**, this project seeks to reveal pricing patterns, highlight the impact of features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, waterfront views, and overall condition, and support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis involves data cleaning, summary statistics, correlation evaluation, and basic data visualizations using only Pandasâ€™ built-in plotting capabilities. This helps to establish a foundational understanding of the housing dataset and prepares the ground for deeper modeling and strategic planning.

Key insights will help the company:
- Identify high-value property characteristics
- Compare waterfront vs. non-waterfront house prices
- Understand pricing trends by floor count and condition
- Detect city-level market dynamics through frequency analysis

This initial investigation is crucial in supporting the company's ongoing efforts to optimize property listings, target investments, and refine pricing strategies.
