# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the **Titanic dataset**, aimed at understanding the **demographics, survival patterns**, and underlying factors that contributed to the outcomes of one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. As a **Data Analyst** at a historical society dedicated to maritime studies, I was tasked with uncovering insights that could shed light on survival trends among passengers and the broader context of the tragedy.

The dataset contains detailed records of passengers, including attributes such as **age, sex, passenger class, fare paid, embarkation point, and survival status**. By leveraging **Pandas** for data manipulation, **NumPy** for numerical computations, and basic **visualization libraries**, this project explores the dataset to extract meaningful patterns.

The key objectives of the analysis include:
- Exploring and summarizing passenger demographics
- Handling missing data and optimizing memory usage
- Preprocessing and normalizing features for accurate analysis
- Filtering and transforming data to derive useful features
- Performing aggregate analysis to understand group-level trends (e.g., survival by class or gender)
- Visualizing key patterns to aid interpretation and communication

This comprehensive exploration provides valuable insights into the factors influencing survival, contributing to the historical understanding of the event and supporting future research on human behavior during crises.
