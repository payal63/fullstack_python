# Sales Data Statistical Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves a comprehensive statistical analysis of sales data to better understand **product performance** and **sales distribution**. As part of a business intelligence initiative, the primary objective is to explore key metrics and patterns in the data to guide decision-making and improve overall sales strategies.

The analysis uses **Python** for performing descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. By examining the spread, central tendency, and variability in the dataset, the project aims to uncover actionable insights such as identifying top-performing products, recognizing underperforming ones, and understanding sales behavior over the covered period.

Key statistical measures include:
- **Total and average daily sales** for overall performance evaluation
- **Best-selling and worst-selling products** to highlight extremes
- **Sales range, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation** to measure data variability
- **Skewness** to assess the direction of sales distribution
- **Percentile values and interquartile range (IQR)** for understanding the spread and potential outliers in the data

By completing this analysis, the company can identify sales trends, detect inconsistencies or outliers, and enhance inventory planning, pricing, and marketing strategies. This foundational analysis paves the way for more advanced forecasting and product-specific performance evaluations in future phases.
