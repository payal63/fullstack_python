# Real Estate Data Analysis with SQLite, Pandas, and Visualization Tools

## Introduction

This project focuses on building and analyzing a structured database to support real estate data insights using the `HousePrices.csv` dataset. The goal is to integrate housing property and sales transaction data into a relational database, enabling powerful querying capabilities and insightful visualizations to uncover **market trends**, **pricing dynamics**, and **city-wise performance**.

As part of the real estate analytics team, I was tasked with importing, exploring, and visualizing this dataset while establishing a connection with a **SQLite database** to perform efficient SQL-based operations. The analysis also leverages **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** for data visualization, and **SQLite3** for database creation and querying.

Through this project, we aim to:
- Understand the structure and summary of the housing dataset
- Visualize pricing and sales trends using both static and interactive plots
- Create and populate relational tables for housing properties and transactions
- Use SQL to filter data and extract meaningful insights, such as evaluating house prices in specific cities like **Seattle**
- Enable cross-platform accessibility of real estate insights through both code and visual dashboards

This end-to-end workflow supports better decision-making for investment strategy, city-level performance tracking, and identifying high-opportunity markets in the real estate industry.
