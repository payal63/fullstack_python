# üêç Python Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based data analysis projects completed as part of various assignments. Each project leverages real-world datasets and applies Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

The assignments range from **weather pattern analysis** to **real estate market trends**, **sales performance**, and **survival analysis**, allowing for practice in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical interpretation, and data visualization. These projects are designed to demonstrate practical skills in using Python to solve diverse analytical problems across industries like **retail**, **housing**, **climate**, and **historical research**.
