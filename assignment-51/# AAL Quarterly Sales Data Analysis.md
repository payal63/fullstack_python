# AAL Quarterly Sales Data Analysis

## Introduction

**AAL** has been a well-recognized name in the U.S. clothing industry since 2000, catering to a diverse customer base including kids, women, men, and seniors. With its expansive presence across states, metropolises, and tier-1 and tier-2 cities, AAL is experiencing substantial growth and is in a critical phase of expansion. To support its strategic investment decisions, the company seeks a detailed analysis of its quarterly sales performance.

As a **data analyst**, I have been assigned to extract meaningful insights from the sales data, evaluate overall and segmented performance, and visualize the findings through various charts and graphs to provide actionable intelligence for the management team.

This project includes:
- **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Importing and inspecting the dataset for missing values and data integrity.
- **Data Normalization**: Standardizing the sales and unit data to scale between 0 and 1 for consistent comparative analysis.
- **Trend Analysis**: Plotting daily sales and unit trends to identify seasonal fluctuations and sales patterns.
- **Monthly Breakdown**: Segmenting the data into October, November, and December to perform detailed month-wise analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the sales and unit data using measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and range.
- **Visualization**: Creating boxplots and line graphs to explore unit and sales distributions across months.
- **Statewise and Groupwise Analysis**: Examining sales distribution across different U.S. states and customer groups.
- **Timewise Trends**: Analyzing temporal changes in sales and units to detect peaks, slumps, and potential opportunities.

This analysis will provide a **comprehensive snapshot** of AALâ€™s recent quarterly performance, helping leadership identify strengths, address weaknesses, and drive informed expansion strategies.
