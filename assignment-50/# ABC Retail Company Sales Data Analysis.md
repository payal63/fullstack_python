# ABC Retail Company Sales Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of **ABC Retail Company's** transaction data to uncover key business insights and support data-driven decision-making for **inventory management**, **marketing strategies**, and **revenue optimization**. As a manager at ABC Retail, I was tasked with analyzing a full year’s worth of transactional records across multiple store locations using Python and data visualization tools.

The dataset includes information such as transaction dates, store locations, product categories, quantities sold, and unit prices. By leveraging powerful Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly Express**, this analysis extracts meaningful metrics to guide strategic business actions.

The core objectives of this analysis are:
- **Revenue analysis** at the transaction and store level
- **Trend analysis** of monthly revenue to understand seasonal patterns
- **Sales volume analysis** by product and product category
- **Store-level performance** evaluation through pivot tables and visualizations
- **Product pricing and revenue distribution** analysis across categories and locations

Through cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data, this project provides actionable insights into top-performing products, high-revenue stores, and monthly performance trends—equipping the leadership team with the knowledge needed to optimize operations and boost profitability.
